Why Opal? 
It's a nice short name. Besides 'ruby' was taken :)

What does the OPAL_NOOB variable do?
It determines if you want to load noob.bash, which has some conveniences for 
DOS users to learn UNIX. Also, some prompting was added to help prevent some 
accidents from occurring.

How can Opal help me?
It creates a nice unix setup quickly. It's great when you want a familiar 
environment on a new machine. If you're a web developer, there are several 
vimrc files to help you comply to various coding standard - including 
Wordpress, Drupal, and CodeIgniter. There are also several utility command to 
make things easier - extract, mkcd, bak, and punch are just a few of them.  
There's even a couple of easter eggs :) vimrc_html makes it easy for to create 
tags correctly, with a poor mans's autocomplete

Why did I create Opal? 
I wanted to create a reusable unix setup I could use across machines. Also, I 
thought it'd be a good opportunity for an open source project. I see a lot of 
people share their dotfiles, and there's a lot of repetition, but I didn't feel 
they were useful enough.

What if I'm not a developer? 
The punch command is great. think punching a timecard. it clocks you in and 
out.  You can even make notes about what you're working on. Use 'say_done' to 
inform you when a long running command is complete. 'bak' will create a backup 
of your file or directory. 'truncate' will remove the contents of a file for 
you - like a huge log file.  Also, 'define' is used to get the defintion of a 
word.
