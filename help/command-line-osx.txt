OS X Command Line Editing Keyboard Shortcuts
================================================================================

CTRL+a   Move cursor to beginning of the line. (I think of this as anchoring my 
         cursor to the start.)
CTRL+e   Move cursor to the end of the line.
CTRL+k   Delete everything from under the cursor to the end of the line. (I 
think of this as killing the rest of my line.)
CTRL+f   Move forward one character. Identical to →.
CTRL+b   Move backward one character. Identical to ←.
ESC+f    Move forward one word.
ESC+b    Move backward one word.  
CTRL+u   Delete everything from under the cursor the beginning of the line.
CTRL+w   Delete from under the cursor to the beginning of the word.
CTRL+r   Recall previous commands by searching for them.
CTRL+t   Transpose (swap) the two characters before the cursor with one another.
ESC+t    Transpose (swap) the two words before the cursor with one another.
CTRL+y   Paste the most previously-deleted string. Basically a sort of 
         command-line editting “undo.”
CTRL+z   Stop the current process and send it to the background.
CTRL+c   Send an SIG_HUP to the current process. The net effect of doing this 
         on the command line is that you cancel your current command and are 
         presented with a blank new line.
CTRL+d   Send an end-of-file special character to the current process. Doing 
         this at the command line is identical to closing your terminal window.
CTRL+p   Recall previous command executed. Identical to ↑.
CTRL+d   Forward delete.
CTRL+h   Backspace.
CTRL+j   Carriage return. Identical to hitting the return key.
CTRL+m   Newline. Identical to return.
CTRL+l   Repaint screen. This is useful if a program’s output is overwriting 
         some text on your terminal. The effect of doing this on a 
         command line is that you clear the screen. Note than in Apple’s 
         Terminal.app, you can also press +K to clear the screen.
CTRL-x + CTRL-x Mark current location in line and jump to beginning of line or 
           second mark if defined. Repeat to jump to between both marks.
CTRL+v     Insert next character verbatim. This is how you escape control 
           sequences. For instance, to literally send a 
CTRL+[     Identical to ESC.
ESC+c      Capitolize word under cursor and move to next word.
ESC+u      Uppercase word under cursor and move to next word.
ESC+l      Lowercase word under cursor and move to next word.
ESC+.      Insert last word from previous command after cursor.
