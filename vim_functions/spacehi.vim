" Section: Documentation {{{1
"
" This plugin will highlight tabs and trailing spaces on a line, with the
" ability to toggle the highlighting on and off. Using highlighting to
" illuminate these characters is preferrable to using listchars and set list
" because it allows you to copy from the vim window without getting shrapnel
" in your buffer.
"
" NOTE: "set list" will override SpaceHi's highlighting.
"
" Highlighting can be turned on and off with the functions SpaceHi() and
" NoSpaceHi() respectively. You can also toggle the highlighting state by
" using ToggleSpaceHi(). By default, ToggleSpaceHi is bound to the key F3.
"
" You can customize the colors by setting the following variables to a string
" of key=val that would normally follow "highlight group" command:
"
"       g:spacehi_spacecolor
"       g:spacehi_tabcolor
"
" The defaults can be found in the "Default Global Vars" section below.
"
" You can give a list of filetypes to exclude 
"
" If you want to highlight tabs and trailing spaces by default for every file
" that is syntax highlighted, you can add the following to your vimrc:
"
"       autocmd syntax * SpaceHi
"
" The author currently uses the following (a little overboard) in his vimrc:
"
"   autocmd BufNewFile,BufReadPost,FilterReadPost,FileReadPost,Syntax * SpaceHi
"   au FileType help NoSpaceHi
